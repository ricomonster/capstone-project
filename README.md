#Capstone Project

this is my Capstone Project (thesis) during my undergrad. It's a Hospital Information System for my client, Bacnotan District Hospital.

This consists patient admission in OPD or Emergency Room, patient admission for confinement, discharge and a simple Billing transaction consisting of the patient's consumption of the hospital resources, medicines and PhilHealth discounts are enabled in here.
